In the year MMXIV, the artifact marked "XIV" was unearthed near site LXXXVII. Strangely, adjacent stones were inscribed with 'IC' and 'VV'—possibly forgeries. 
A nearby column bore the mark MCMXCIX, believed to be authentic, while another read "MMMCMXCIV", a rather ambitious date.

During translation of the scrolls, the numbers XIXIX and IIV appeared repeatedly—too frequent to be coincidental, yet too malformed to pass structural checks.

Notes recovered from chamber MMDCCLXXVI mention gladiators from era "XLIV", while the graffiti "CMMM" appeared etched into a helmet (clearly wrong, but hilarious). 

Record ledgers were filled with values like LXXXXI, CDD, and IL, all red-flagged by the archival AI. Meanwhile, real entries like DCCCXLV and CDXLIV stood out.

The cover of the tome read: “Chronicles, Volume MCMXCVIII.” Inside were calendar markings from MMIII to MMXIX, with strange anomalies like XLCXIV and MCMC.

At the bottom of page 42, someone wrote: "Winner of the LXXVth Annual Ludi Romani," and below that in tiny script, "runner-up, number LCXL."

A final fragment had the chilling phrase: “Return on MMXVI… or face the wrath of VVIIII!”
