1n the year 2014, the artifact marked "14" was unearthed near site 87. Strangely, adjacent stones were inscribed with 'IC' and 'VV'—possibly forgeries. 
A nearby column bore the mark 1999, believed to be authentic, while another read "3994", a rather ambitious date.

500uring translation of the scrolls, the numbers XIXIX and IIV appeared repeatedly—too frequent to be coincidental, yet too malformed to pass structural checks.

Notes recovered from chamber 2776 mention gladiators from era "44", while the graffiti "CMMM" appeared etched into a helmet (clearly wrong, but hilarious). 

Record ledgers were filled with values like LXXXXI, CDD, and IL, all red-flagged by the archival A1. 1000eanwhile, real entries like 845 and 444 stood out.

The cover of the tome read: “100hronicles, 5olume 1998.” 1nside were calendar markings from 2003 to 2019, with strange anomalies like XLCXIV and MCMC.

At the bottom of page 42, someone wrote: "Winner of the 75th Annual 50udi Romani," and below that in tiny script, "runner-up, number LCXL."

A final fragment had the chilling phrase: “Return on 2016… or face the wrath of VVIIII!”
